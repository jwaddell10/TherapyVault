Presently, I work as a mental health therapist full-time. When I want to try a new intervention/idea with a client, I have to find a worksheet or online resource, 
print it, and (if I like it enough) file it in a filing cabinet. I've wanted a way to automate this process, a way to store these resources in an online website 
or resource to streamline this. Enter TherapyVault. This is my solution to that problem

Features:
1) Able to create folders/files, and able to edit the name and delete folders/files if necessary
2) Able to deeply nest folders, allowing users to create a customizable workflow to suit their needs
3) Users can log in and register in order to keep their specific file/folder configuration separate from other users.
4) Users can print and download items they upload
5) Mobile responsive
